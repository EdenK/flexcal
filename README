A jQuery UI datepicker widget that allows for multiple calendars and calendar systems.
Documentation at http://bililite.com/blog/2009/04/03/new-jquery-widget-flexcal/

jquery.flexcal.js is the main file; it requires the flexcal.css file for styling.

It depends on my jQuery UI subclassing routines, jquery.ui.subclass.ui (documentation at http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/ ) and popup widget, jquery.textpopup.js (documentation at http://bililite.com/blog/2009/01/02/new-ui-widgets-textpopup-and-hebrewkeyboard/ )


jquery.timepickr.js is a time picker widget (documentation at http://bililite.com/blog/2009/07/09/updating-timepickr/ )

jquery.calendars.picker-mock.js is a stub that allows localization using Keith Woods's calendar systems (http://keith-wood.name/calendarsRef.html ) without loading his whole datepicker. See http://bililite.com/blog/2015/02/13/improved-flexcal/ for details.
